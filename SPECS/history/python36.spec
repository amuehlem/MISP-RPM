# ===========================================
# Notes from bootstraping Python 3.6 in RHEL7
# ===========================================
#
# This is a bootstrapping sequence tailored to python3 in RHEL7.
# Build in the following order:
#
# 1. python-rpm-macros & python-rpm-generators
#    (and update redhat-rpm-config to require python-srpm-macros if not done
#    already)
# 2. python3, without rewheel (use %%bcond_with rewheel instead of
#     %%bcond_without)
# 3. python-setuptools, with bootstrap
# 4. python-pip, with bootstrap
# 5. python-wheel
# 6. python-setuptools, without bootstrap
# 7. python-pip, without bootstrap
# 8. python3, with rewheel
#
# If there are more packages added in the future, rebuild those after step 8.

%description
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{name} package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{name}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{name}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{name}-tkinter and %{name}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{name}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{name}-" prefix.

# /usr/bin/python3-debug was moved from here:

%description debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between
this and the standard version of Python, but the debugging features mean that
C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version
separately.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag ("d") in the filename,
so extensions for both versions can co-exist in the same directory.

# it found non-library files directly in /usr/lib/
# (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562980)

- rework %%files in the light of PEP 3147 (__pycache__)
- drop our configuration patch to Setup.dist (patch 0): setup.py should do a
better job of things, and the %%files explicitly lists our modules (r82746
appears to break the old way of doing things).  This leads to various modules
changing from "foomodule.so" to "foo.so".  It also leads to the optimized build

_hashlib; _weakref becomes a builtin module; xxsubtype goes away (it's only for
testing/devel purposes)

* Mon May 24 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-6
- build and install two different configurations of Python 3: debug and
standard, packaging the debug build in a new "python3-debug" subpackage
(patch 103)

* Tue Apr 13 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-5

debuginfo subpackage, rather than the libs subpackage
- introduce %%{py_SOVERSION} and %%{py_INSTSONAME} to reflect the upstream
configure script, and to avoid fragile scripts that try to figure this out
dynamically (e.g. for the -gdb.py change)
